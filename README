A simple chat application written in Racket as an university project.

* Design is self-invented, hence broken :)
* When the server wants to broadcast messages, it wakes
each thread (one thread per user), which then sends the message
to the respective client. This is BAD / inefficient.
* Protocol is broken (again self-invented).
* GUI uses too much protocol.
* etc.

This code is provided as is in the public domain.
